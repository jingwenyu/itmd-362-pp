# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: I like the simple design of the mouse. It looks appealing and clean.

* Behavioral: I was having troubles with scrolling, left, and right click when I first used it. 

* Reflective: The logo reflects the simple design of the mouse. 

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Have suitable font and color
2. Usability- easy to use 
3. Understand the purpose of each element of the page
